The Electric Vehicle Insights Dashboard is a fully interactive web application developed using R Shiny, Shiny was selected for its seamless integration of data manipulation, statistical computing, and visualization, all within a single R environment.

With R libraries like dplyr, ggplot2, and plotly, responsive visualizations and real-time filtering with minimal overhead are delivered. Additionally, deploying via shinyapps.io removed the need for complex infrastructure or JavaScript-heavy setups, while still allowing optional integration with tools like React for enhanced UI dynamics.
